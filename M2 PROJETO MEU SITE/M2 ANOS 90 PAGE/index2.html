           <p>You are appreciated

            When I was young, me and my mama had beef<br>            
            Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets<br>            
            Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face<br>            
            Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place<br>            
            Suspended from school and scared to go home<br>            
            I was a fool, with the big boys breaking all the rules<br>            
            I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years<br>            
            We was poorer than the other little kids<br>            
            <br>            
            And even though we had different daddies, the same drama<br>            
            When things went wrong, we'd blame mama<br>            
            I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell<br>            
            Hugging on my mama from a jail cell<br>            
            And who'd think in elementary<br>            
            Hey, I'd see the penitentiary one day?<br>            
            And running from the police, that's right<br>            
            Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside<br>            
            <br>            
            And even as a crack fiend, mama<br>            
            You always was a black queen, mama<br>            
            I finally understand: For a woman it ain't easy<br>            
            Trying to raise a man<br>            
            You always was committed<br>            
            A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it<br>            
            <br>            
            There's no way I can pay you back<br>            
            But the plan is to show you that I understand<br>            
            You are appreciated<br>            
            <br>            
            (Lady, don't you know we love ya?) Dear mama<br>            
            (Sweet lady, place no one above ya) you are appreciated<br>            
            (Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?)<br>            
            <br>            
            Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair<br>            
            No love from my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there<br>            
            He passed away and I didn't cry<br>            
            'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger<br>            
            They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless<br>            
            But all along I was looking for a father, he was gone<br>            
            I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs<br>                 
            They showed a young brother love<br>            
            <br>            
            I moved out and started really hanging<br>            
            I needed money of my own, so I started slanging<br>            
            I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks<br>            
            It feels good putting money in your mailbox<br>            
            I love paying rent when the rent is due<br>            
            I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to ya<br>            
            'Cause when I was low, you was there for me<br>            
            You never left me alone because you cared for me<br>            
            <br>            
            And I could see you coming home after work late<br>            
            You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hotplate<br>            
            You just working with the scraps you was given<br>            
            And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving<br>            
            But now the road got rough, you're alone<br>            
            You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own<br>            
            <br>            
            And there's no way I can pay you back<br>            
            But my plan is to show you that I understand<br>            
            You are appreciated<br>            
            <br>            
            (Lady, don't you know we love ya?) And dear mama<br>            
            (Sweet lady, place no one above ya) you are appreciated<br>            
            (Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?)<br>            
            <br>            
            Pour out some liquor and I reminisce<br>            
            'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama<br>            
            And when it seems that I'm hopeless<br>            
            You say the words that can get me back in focus<br>            
            When I was sick as a little kid<br>            
            To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did<br>            
            And all my childhood memories<br>            
            Are full of all the sweet things you did for me<br>            
            <br>            
            And even though I act crazy<br>            
            I gotta thank the Lord that you made me<br>            
            There are no words that can express how I feel<br>            
            You never kept a secret, always stayed real<br>            
            And I appreciate how you raised me<br>            
            And all the extra love that you gave me<br>            
            I wish I could take the pain away<br>            
            If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day<br>            
            Everything will be alright if you hold on<br>            
            It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on<br>            
            <br>            
            And there's no way I can pay you back<br>            
            But my plan is to show you that I understand<br>            
            You are appreciated<br>            
            <br>            
            (Lady, don't you know we love ya?) Dear mama<br>            
            (Sweet lady, place no one above ya) you are appreciated<br>            
            (Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?) And dear mama<br>            
            (Sweet lady) dear mama<br>

            <p>Break em'<br>
                Shit!<br>
                Yo!<br>
                Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God<br>
                I don't know but today seems kinda odd<br>
                No barking from the dogs, no smog<br>
                And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog<br>
                I got my grub on, but didn't pig out<br>
                Finally, got a call from a girl wanna dig out<br>
                Hooked it up on later as I hit the do'<br>
                Thinking will I live, another twenty-fo'<br>
                I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top<br>
                And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop<br>
                Had to stop at a red light<br>
                Looking in my mirror not a jacker in sight<br>
                And everything is alright<br>
                I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night<br>
                Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all<br>
                Which court, are y'all playin' basketball?<br>
                Get me on the court and I'm trouble<br>
                Last week fucked around and got a triple double<br>
                Freaking niggas everyway like M. J<br>
                I can't believe, today was a good day<br>
                <br>
                Drove to the pad and hit the showers<br>
                Didn't even get no static from the cowards<br>
                Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me<br>
                Saw the police and they rolled right past me<br>
                No flexin', didn't even look in a niggaz direction<br>
                As I ran the intersection<br>
                Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps<br>
                What's the haps on the craps<br>
                Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em<br>
                Roll em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break em<br>
                With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven<br>
                Seven even back do' Little Joe I picked up the cash flow<br>
                Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' domino<br>
                Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L. A<br>
                Today was a good day<br>
                <br>
                Left my niggaz house paid<br>
                Picked up a girl been tryin' to fuck since the twelve grade<br>
                It's ironic, I had the booze she had the chronic<br>
                The Lakers beat the Supersonics I felt on the big fat fanny<br>
                Pulled out the jammy, and killed the poor nanny<br>
                And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep<br>
                Put her ass to sleep<br>
                Woke her up around one<br>
                She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun<br>
                Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting<br>
                Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion<br>
                I was glad everything had worked out<br>
                Dropped her ass off, then I chirped out<br>
                Today was like one of those fly dreams<br>
                Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams<br>
                No helicopter looking for a murder<br>
                Two in the morning got the fat burger<br>
                Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp<br>
                And it read Ice Cube's a pimp<br>
                Drunk as hell but no throwing up<br>
                Halfway home and my pager still blowing up<br>
                Today I didn't even have to use my A. K<br>
                I got to say it was a good day<br>
                <br>
                Hey wait, wait a minute fool<br>
                Stop the shit<br>
                What the fuck am I thinking about?
                <br>
